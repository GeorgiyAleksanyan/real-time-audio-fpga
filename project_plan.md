# Real-Time Audio FPGA Project Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines an Agile-style development roadmap for the Real-Time Audio DSP System on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA. The project implements an end-to-end audio processing and transmission system that captures live audio, applies digital signal processing effects in custom hardware, and transmits results to a host PC for visualization.

### Component Design Strategy

The project balances custom hardware design with strategic use of proven IP cores:

**Custom-Designed Components**: All core DSP algorithms (filters, effects) and control logic will be implemented from scratch to demonstrate FPGA design skills and provide maximum flexibility for optimization.

**Third-Party IP Integration**: [Placeholder - Specific Xilinx IP cores for memory controllers, clock management, and potentially advanced interfaces will be identified and integrated as needed during implementation phases.]

**Open-Source Resources**: [Placeholder - Any open-source Verilog modules or reference designs will be documented here with proper attribution and licensing compliance.]

### Project Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: Demonstrate a complete system-level design bridging hardware and software
- **Technical Goals**:
  - Implement real-time audio capture via I2S interface
  - Design custom DSP cores in Verilog for low-latency audio processing
  - Establish reliable UART communication between FPGA and PC
  - Create real-time visualization system for processed audio data
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Master digital logic design and synthesizable Verilog
  - Implement hardware-accelerated DSP algorithms
  - Understand SoC architecture and hardware/software co-design
  - Develop verification and debugging skills

## Sprint Structure

The project follows a 3-sprint approach aligned with the technical phases, with each sprint lasting 2-3 weeks.
